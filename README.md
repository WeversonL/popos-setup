# Script for Ubuntu Based's

## These scripts can be changed to your preference, in order to speed up your installation

Script created in order to install and configure some tools used by me in PopOS, either on the desktop or in Ubuntu WSL2. 

> *   The first one to run must be the bash.sh file [responsible for installations]
> *   After the previous step, run zsh.sh [responsible for configurations and others]

## Check the script before running!! If a module is not compatible with your hardware, or if you don't want that installation to be done.

### Still in development
